To do this, edit the file /boot/config.txt, and change the line
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
to
hdmi_force_hotplug=0
or comment it our.
see https://www.shellhacks.com/raspberry-pi-force-hdmi-hotplug/

to auto start vision on the pi at boot, edit the file /etc/rc.local
this is a shell script run at boot
add:
/path/to/start-vision.sh &
to run the vision startup script in a seperate process
